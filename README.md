# DSA Notes (Python)

This repository contains my personal notes and solutions for various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems solved in **Python**. The aim of this repository is to document my learning and problem-solving process for DSA topics, including explanations, code implementations, and performance analysis.

The problems range from beginner to advanced levels and cover a variety of key topics such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Binary, Binary Search Tree)
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my personal solutions and notes related to **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. Each problem typically includes the following:

- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem.
- **Approach**: The approach I used to solve the problem, including any relevant algorithms.
- **Code**: A Python implementation of the solution.
- **Time Complexity**: Analysis of the time complexity of the solution.
- **Space Complexity**: Analysis of the space complexity of the solution.

These solutions are meant to help me solidify my understanding of DSA concepts and can also serve as a reference for others learning the same topics.
